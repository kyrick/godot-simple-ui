# Simple UI

This is suuuuper basic project I created to learn Godot UIs. 

I followed the GDQuest intro tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1E_y9AIqow

This project uses the [FarmPuzzleAnimals](https://comigo.itch.io/farm-puzzle-animals) pack created by [CoMiGo](https://comigo.itch.io/)
